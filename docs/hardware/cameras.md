# Camera Inventory

Six Axis cameras covering all zones of the property, plus one environmental sensor.

**Deployment status (2026-06-12):** All 6 cameras live in Frigate + HA. MQTT analytics (AOA, scene, SPL) and D6210 air quality via **Danielsson Insights add-on** on HAOS (`/share/danielsson-insights/`). Loitering scenarios verified on all 6 cameras (2026-06-07).

## Front Entrance

### Axis P3288 — `front`

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | Axis P3288-V (or P3288-LVE outdoor) |
| Zone ID | `front` |
| Location | Front entrance — facing the door / gate |
| Mount | Wall or ceiling at entrance |
| IP | TBD |

**Purpose:** Primary person detection at the main entry point. High-resolution capture for approaching persons.

**Current status:** Active in Frigate, recording.

**HA entities (live):**
- `camera.front` — live feed
- `binary_sensor.front_person_occupancy` — person detected
- `binary_sensor.front_motion` — motion
- `sensor.front_person_count` — detection count (24h)

**Planned Frigate role:**
- Dual-stream: full-res record + 640×360 detect
- Detect objects: `person`
- Snapshots enabled for event timeline
- Zone: `front_door_zone` for targeted alerts

## Driveway

### Axis Q3558-LVE — `driveway_wide`

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | Axis Q3558-LVE |
| Zone ID | `driveway_wide` |
| Location | Driveway — elevated, wide-angle overview |
| Mount | Pole or building wall, high position |
| IP | TBD |

**Purpose:** Full driveway area situational awareness. Vehicle detection, general presence, and overview context for other driveway events.

**Current status:** Live in Frigate + HA. AOA + scene MQTT active.

**Planned HA role:**
- `camera.frigate_driveway_wide` — overview feed
- `binary_sensor.frigate_driveway_wide_car` — vehicle arrival trigger
- `binary_sensor.frigate_driveway_wide_person` — person in driveway

**Planned Frigate role:**
- Detect objects: `person`, `car`
- Record: continuous during motion
- Zone: `driveway_entry` for vehicle-specific alerts
- Lower detect FPS acceptable (5 fps) — area overview, not ID

**Future Axis analytics role:**
- ACAP application for vehicle counting or loitering detection
- MQTT metadata published directly to HA MQTT broker

### Axis M2036 — `driveway_id`

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | Axis M2036-LE |
| Zone ID | `driveway_id` |
| Location | Driveway — fixed point, optimized for identification |
| Mount | Aimed at gate / entry point for face and plate |
| IP | TBD |

**Purpose:** Identification-grade capture of persons and vehicles entering the driveway. Higher FPS and tighter field of view than the overview camera. Hosts the D6210 air quality sensor on its I/O port.

**Current status:** Live in Frigate + HA. AOA + scene MQTT active.

**Planned HA role:**
- `camera.frigate_driveway_id` — identification feed
- `binary_sensor.frigate_driveway_id_person` — identification trigger
- `sensor.driveway_env_*` — environmental data via D6210

**Planned Frigate role:**
- Detect objects: `person`, `car`

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | Axis Q1656-LE |
| Zone ID | `backyard` |

| Mount | Building wall, elevated |
| IP | TBD |

**Purpose:** Backyard perimeter monitoring. Person detection for after-hours alerts. Garden / outdoor activity context.

**Current status:** Live in Frigate + HA. AOA + scene MQTT active.

**Planned HA role:**
- `camera.frigate_backyard` — backyard feed
- `binary_sensor.frigate_backyard_person` — perimeter breach alert

**Planned Frigate role:**
- Detect objects: `person`
- Motion-triggered recording
- Zone: `backyard_perimeter` — exclude known animal paths if needed
- Mask: exclude sky / road if in frame

---

## Storage Building

### Axis Q1656 — `storage_ext`

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | Axis Q1656-LE |
| Zone ID | `storage_ext` |

- `binary_sensor.frigate_storage_ext_person` — approach detection

**Planned Frigate role:**
- Detect objects: `person`
- Zone: `storage_door_zone`
- Snapshots: enabled

---

### Axis M1055 — `storage_int`

| Attribute | Value |
|---|---|
